
## Run a simulation 

First, you need to set a path to a (preferably empty) folder for Simulations to save to. This path can be set in Model_run. 

That is all you should need before starting that Script and a simulation will begin. 


## Parameters 

In terms of parameters that you can modify, most are contained within the 'Model_initialParameters' file. 


For the intercellular diffusion there are:

**The N, Y, and Pmax terms were arbitrary diffusion values that interact with the Base permeability term (5).
**These terms become more significant when considering multiple diffusing molecules and multiple Cx isoforms, which isn't currently implemented. 


(1-4)the parameters for production and degradation in each cell type. 
(5) the base permeability of each cell type (open_prob) 

(6) If you wanted to look at different molecules you could choose a different diffusion coefficient (D_camp) 



** Also, division times are something else that has a large impact. We used the experimentally determined values that Doug found during LIF withdrawal 
However, RA-treatment does cause a decrease in proliferation.Changes to proliferation change the required production and degradation rates



In terms of other parameters you can change: 


There are two types of inhibition that you can include, either AC inhibition or GJ inhibition. (From Model_run, which modulate parts of the Simulation file)
You can have it cyclic or constant depending on 'duration' and 'inhib_times' set during initialization.
If you just want it to be constant though it is easier to just change the parameters above (1) and (5), respectively. 



If you want to change the differentiation mechanism or the threshold value then the bottom of the simulationObjects script contains the function directing differentiation. 


## My metrics aren't in the same order in the code as they are in the Metric Description Image.
